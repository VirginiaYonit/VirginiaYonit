## Ciao, I'm Virginia

Welcome to my GitHub. After 20+ years in airport operations, I have transformed a long-standing fascination for structure, people, and communication into a new focus: data analytics, business intelligence, and generative AI.

### Who I am

I bring operational expertise from highly regulated environments, combined with newly acquired technical skills.
I work with Python, SQL, R, and BI tools to make data more readable, useful, and human-centered.
I believe clarity is power and that the right questions matter more than flashy dashboards.
I'm currently working on real-world projects that blend analysis, culture, and storytelling.
