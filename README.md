## Ciao, I'm Virginia

Welcome to my GitHub. After 20+ years in airport operations, I have transformed a long-standing fascination for structure, people, and communication into a new focus: data analytics, business intelligence, and generative AI.

### Who I am

Shaped by years in complex operations, I approach data with a practical mindset, exploring how structure and coordination can turn insight into action.
Daily practice in Python, R, SQL, and BI tools applied to real-world data problems from cleaning and analysis to machine learning and AI workflows.
Currently training as a Project Manager (IBM) and advancing in AI through EITCI European certification.
