## Hi, I'm Virginia Levy Abulafia,

welcome to my GitHub. For 25 years, I developed operational rigor and a structured mindset by leading teams and managing complex, high-stakes systems in highly regulated environments (e.g., airport operations).

Today, I apply that rigor to data. My focus is on Functional Analysis, Requirements Engineering, and
Compliance-by-Design systems, ensuring that platform capabilities are measurable, reusable, and
aligned with organizational goals.

Daily practice in Python, R, SQL, and BI tools applied to real-world data problems from cleaning and analysis to machine learning and AI workflows.
Currently advancing in AI through EITCI European certification.
