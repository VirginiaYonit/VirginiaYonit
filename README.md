## Ciao, I'm Virginia

Welcome to my GitHub. After 20+ years in airport operations, I’ve decided to turn a long-time fascination for structure, people, and communication into a new direction: data analytics, business intelligence, and generative AI.

### Who I am

I combine operational experience from highly regulated environments with newly acquired technical skills.  
I work with Python, SQL, R, and BI tools to make data more readable, useful, and human.  
I believe clarity is power and that good questions matter more than flashy dashboards.

Currently focused on real-world projects that mix analysis, culture, and storytelling.
